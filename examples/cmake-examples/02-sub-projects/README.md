## Concepts

### Adding a Sub-Directory
---
A CMakeLists.txt file can include and call sub-directories which include a CMakeListst.txt files.

```php
add_subdirectory()
add_subdirectory()
add_subdirectory()
add_subdirectory()
```

### Referencing Sub-Project Directories
When a project is created using the `project()` command, CMake will automaticaly create a number of variables which can be used to reference details about the project. These variables can then used by other sub-projects or the main project. For examples, to reference the source directory for a different project you can use.

The variables created by CMake include:

- `PROJECT_NAME`        : The name of the project set by the current `project()`.
- `CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME`  : the name of the first project set by the `project() `command, i.e. the top level project.
- `PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR`  : The source director of the current project.
- `PROJECT_BINARY_DIR`  : The build directory for the current project.
- `name_SOURCE_DIR`     : The source directory of the project called "name". In this example the source directories created would be `sublibrary1_SOURCE_DIR``, sublibrary2_SOURCE_DIR`, and `subbinary_SOURCE_DIR`
- `name_BINARY_DIR`     : The binary directory of the project called "name". In this example the binary directories created would be `sublibrary1_BINARY_DIR`, `sublibrary2_BINARY_DIR`, and `subbinary_BINARY_DIR`

### Header only Libraries
If you have a library that is created as a header only library, cmake supports the INTERFACE target to allow creating a target without any build output. More details can be found from here

> add_library(${PROJECT_NAME} INTERFACE)

When creating the target you can also include directories for that target using the INTERFACE scope. The INTERFACE scope is use to make target requirements that are used in any Libraries that link this target but not in the compilation of the target itself.

```php
target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME}
    INTERFACE
        ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/include
)
```

### Referencing Libraries from Sub-Projects
If a sub-project creates a library, it can be referenced by other projects by calling the name of the project in the `target_link_libraries()` command. This means that you donâ€™t have to reference the full path of the new library and it is added as a dependency.

```php
target_link_libraries(subbinary
    PUBLIC
        sublibrary1
)
```
Alternatively, you can create an alias target which allows you to reference the target in read only contexts.

To create an alias target run:

```php
add_library(sublibrary2)
add_library(sub::lib2 ALIAS sublibrary2)
```
To reference the alias, just it as follows:
```php
target_link_libraries(subbinary
    sub::lib2
)
```

### Include directories from sub-projects
When adding the libraries from the sub-projects, starting from cmake v3, there is no need to add the projects include directories in the include directories of the binary using them.
This is controlled by the scope in the `target_include_directories()` command when creating the libraries. In this example because the subbinary executable links the sublibrary1 and sublibrary2 libraries it will automatically include the `${sublibrary1_SOURCE_DIR}/inc` and `${sublibrary2_SOURCE_DIR}/inc` folders as they are exported with the PUBLIC and INTERFACE scopes of the libraries.
