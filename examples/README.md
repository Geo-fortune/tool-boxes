## Introduction
CMake is a cross-platform open-source meta-build system which can build, test and package software. It can be used to support multiple native build environments including make, Apple’s xcode and Microsoft Visual Studio.

This repository includes some example modern CMake configurations which I have picked up when exploring it’s usage for various projects. The examples are laid out in a tutorial like format. The first examples are very basic and slowly increase in complexity drawing on previous examples to show more complex use cases.
